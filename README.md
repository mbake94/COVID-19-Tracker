# COVID-19-Tracker

This appplication is a tracker for COVID-19. 

If a patient is concerned, they will start this program. 
The program will ask for their information, and then chack their temperature. If their temperature is normal, our clinic will send them home with instructions to stay quarantined for 14 days, and give the patient and updated version of their documents. 
If the patient's temperature is too high or too low, we will start a screening, and check for their symptoms, and ask if they've been in contact with any other people.
